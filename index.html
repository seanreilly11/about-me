					<p>In 2018, I commenced a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in Software Engineering at Victoria University. After 18 months, I decided that I wanted to study something more specific and I really enjoy web development so I changed to studying a Diploma in Web and UX Design at Yoobee School of Design.</p>

					<p>Studying Software Engineering gave me knowledge in object-oriented languages such as Java and C++ as well as general knowledge in constructing projects in groups and with deadlines.</p>
